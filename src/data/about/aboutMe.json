I have three different bachelor's degrees in IT engineering, Electrical engineering, and International law. I am also a master's degree student in communication engineering at Aalto University.\n\nI am interested in web development, IoT, system architecture, DevOps, and machine learning in computer science. I'm also passionate about digitalization in industrial automation since I have a rich background in working with automation systems and edge devices.\n\nI am currently exploring machine learning and artificial intelligence to expand my suite of skills and technologies.\n\nOutside of tech, I like cooking, reading about history, management skills and psychology, playing sudoku, watching movies, and jugging.\n\nI also like meeting new people and getting to know their ideas, perspectives, and backgrounds on various topics and disciplines; this allows me to be a better team member and an efficient and collaborative problem solver.</div>",
